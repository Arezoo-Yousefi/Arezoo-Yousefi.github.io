<h2>HTML, CSS and javascript project</h2>

<p>This is a bio site I have created from scratch and tried what I have learned in CSS and javascript.<br>
At first I created the site with HTML and Css and then in second part I added Javascript to make some changes to it.</br>
In this course I have also learned working with Bootstrap and jquery.</p>

<p>There are some small projects I made using JavaScript.</p>
